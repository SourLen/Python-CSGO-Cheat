# ProjectX
All in one external CSGO cheat written in python.
It is probably undetected by VAC but im not reponsible for any future bans if you use this cheat in competitive. 
Dont use silentaim with a high fov, its way to obvious and you are gonna get banned by VACNET
I have only tested this cheat against bots and you shouldnt use it against real people. This is ONLY MEANT AS A POC!
It comes with a nice Gui and can be installed very easily.
Requires Python3 and pip (aswell as CSGO obviously)
